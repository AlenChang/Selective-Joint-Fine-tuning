The codes are not maintained for a long time. I will update the codes and make the nearest neighbor search more each using python.

1. Since we need to build histograms, so we need to know the value range of each channel in deep feature maps. Then you need to first run the ./get_the_stats_of_features.sh on ImageNet at first.
